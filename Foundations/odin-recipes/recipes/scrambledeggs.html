            <li>9 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>

            <li>Beat eggs and red pepper flakes together in a bowl.
                Stir tomatoes, feta, and basil leaves into egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until
                oil starts to shimmer. Pour egg mixture into hot oil and cook,
