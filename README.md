The Odin Project is an open source online curriculum for learning web development. They help people to pick up the skills they need to get hired as web developers.

> This is a repository to save and share my web development progress going through The Odin Project - the Foundations part and yet to be decided decided developer path. 

## :dart: Goal

The goal of The Odin Project is to provide a complete path for students to go from zero programming knowledge to employed as web developers while working with other students and picking up the skills to become self sufficient along the way.

**But for my personal goal, I would say it is to become a good web developer. Learning the skills needed to achieve it is most likely the biggest part in the process.**

## :computer: Technologies

All students are initially enrolled into the Foundations Course. This part gives a chance to explore several of the languages and technologies used for web development. Foundations introduces:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git

> Also, there are mini-projects that are used as exercises to test the knowledge.

Once Foundations is complete, students have two paths to choose from: Fullstack Ruby on Rails and Fullstack JavaScript.

**I'm still on the foundations part and haven't decided yet on which path to choose, but I intend to go with the JavaScript one.**
